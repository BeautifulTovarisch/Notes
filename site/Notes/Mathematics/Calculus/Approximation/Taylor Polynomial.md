# Taylor Polynomial

From the discussion in [[Polynomial Approximation]], we found a general formula describing a polynomial which can be used to approximate a function.

> [!info] Taylor's Formula
> Let $f$ be a function with derivatives to the order $n$ at $x = a$. Then there exists a unique polynomial $P$ of degree $\leqslant n$ such that:
> $$
> P(a) = f(a), P'(a) = f'(a), \dots P^{(n)}(a) = f^{(n)}(a)
> $$

> $$
> P(x) = \sum_{k=0}^n \frac {f^{(n)}(a)} {k!} (x-a)^k
> $$

> We relate $P$ to $f$ with $P = T_nf(x ; a)$, which reads
>> The **Taylor Polynomial** of degree $n$ generated by $f$ at $x = a$

## Example Taylor Polynomials

Applying Taylor's formula for carefully chosen values of $x$ we can derive results for several functions:

> [!example] The Exponential Function
> Recall the Taylor formula for $e^x$
> $$
> T_n(e^x) = \sum_{k=0}^n \frac {x^k} {k!}
> $$
>
> At $x = 1$, we have $e^x = e$ for order $n$ derivatives (for any $n \geqslant 1$), so then
> $$
> T_n(e^x;1) = \sum_{k=0}^n \frac {1} {k!}(x - 1)^k
> $$

> [!example] The Sine Function
> We begin by looking for a pattern in the derivatives of $\sin x$:
> $$
> \begin{array}{c,c,c,c}
> f(x) = \sin x & f'(x) = \cos x & f''(x) = -\sin x & f'''(x) = -\cos x & f^{(4)}(x) = \sin x
> \end{array}
> $$
>
> At $x = 0$, we see that the *even* derivatives are $(-1)^n \sin 0 = 0$ and the *odd* derivatives are $(-1)^n \cos 0 = \pm 1$:
> $$
> \begin{align}
> &\sin^{(2n)} x &= (-1)^n \cdot \sin 0 &= 0 \\
> &\sin^{(2n+1)} x &= (-1)^n \cdot \cos 0 &= (-1)^n
> \end{align}
> $$
>
> Applying our formula we have:
> $$
> T_{2n+1}\sin x
> = \sum_{k=0}^{2n+1} \frac {(-1)^n x^k} {k!}
> = \sum_{k=0}^n \frac {x^{2k+1}} {(2k+1)!} (-1)^k
> $$

> [!example] The Cosine Function
> Similarly, for $\cos x$ we find the *even* derivatives at $x = 0$ are equal to $(-1)^n$, hence:
> $$
> T_{2n} \cos x
> = \sum_{k=0}^n \frac {x^{2k}} {2k!} (-1)^k
> $$
