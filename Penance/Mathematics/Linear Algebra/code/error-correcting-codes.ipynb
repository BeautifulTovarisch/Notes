    "In this lab, we use matrix multiplication to explore the ideas behind hamming codes and their use in error-correction. We use a **generator** matrix in order to represent a vector space. In particular, a generator matrix for a linear code is a matrix whose columns are generators for the set of codewords $\\mathcal{C}$.\n",

    "For some vector $p$, we see by the linear-combination form of matrix multiplication that $G * p$ is a linear combination of the columns of $G$ and is therefore in $\\mathcal{C}$ and so it is a codeword."
