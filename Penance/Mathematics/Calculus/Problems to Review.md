Problems for which I have forgotten fundamental knowledge or are otherwise too difficult for me to solve. These problems should be revisited a few days after looking up the solution in order to solidify understanding.

If fundamental knowledge is needed, then the decision to halt progress in Calculus and return to more elementary texts should be considered.

## Concepts of Integral Calculus

- 1.5.9 (Properties of Polynomials)
- 1.7.2-1.7.5 (Geometry)
- 1.11.4 (b, c, d, e) (Proofs with floor functions)
- 1.15.3 (Equality of an integral over a, b and its reflection over the same interval)
- 1.15.6 (Tedious, but interesting problem, good to practice manipulations of series)
- 1.15.7 (Get some practice with Series)
