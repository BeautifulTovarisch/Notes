Problems for which I have forgotten fundamental knowledge or are otherwise too difficult for me to solve. These problems should be revisited a few days after looking up the solution in order to solidify understanding.

If fundamental knowledge is needed, then the decision to halt progress in Calculus and return to more elementary texts should be considered.
