## Data Structures and Algorithms Review

Implement the following data structures and have a thorough understanding before tackling a more challenging algorithms book:

- [ ] Balanced Binary Search Tree
	- [ ] Heap
	- [ ] AVL Tree
	- [ ] Splay Tree
	- [ ] RB Tree
- [ ] Priority Queue
- [ ] Randomized Quicksort
- [x] Mergesort
- [ ] Graphs
	- [ ] Dijkstra's
	- [ ] Prim's
	- [ ] Kruskal's
	- [x] Breadth-First
- [ ] Dynamic Programming
	- [ ] Practice
	- [ ] Practice
	- [ ] Practice

Implementations should include worst-case analysis and unit tests (ideally against a brute-force oracle).
